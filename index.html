<h2> Sto and his day </h2>
<p>
	<em>
		<strong>
	Sto loves it here, Sto can't imagine leaving this place. Sto jogs around in his building shoes every morning before he has to get apparelled for work. When Sto is at work the professionals are at the table discussing the logistics in making the never seen before button ride. Literaaly a button on the computer like the letter "R" on a computer is enlargened and made to be a ride for anyone who wishes to ride it. A lowercase R is for the tiny kids that would like to try, and the Capital R is for the adults that would like to try. Sto loves Planet K and like a prayer just has to say "Planet K is great in deed, there's lots of fun and some greed,
 	but best of all there's lots of space, for you and you to make a place
 	Planet K is the place to beeeeeeeeee"
